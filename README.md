The game is simple, just select your difficulty, represented in types of locations (...and also...), and press the button to play!
When the game starts, you will have 3 lives and a timer. Click to catch the mosquitoes in time and don't let them get away! Every time one escapes, the player loses one life. Just keep it up until the timer ends.
If the player runs out of lives, the player loses and the game ends. If the timer ends, means the player won, and the game ends as well.
Increasing the difficulty will increase the spawn rate of the mosquitoes and shorten the time they stay on screen. Also, increases the time taken for the player to win.

The game flow starts in the index.html screen and all the screens can be accessed from there; game.html when the game starts, you_won.html when the player wins, and game_over.html when the player loses.
